* Overall plan 
1. Start collecting metoffice data using the API
2. Start collecting XCWeather data by scraping it
3. Start collecting ground truth data by scraping it
4. Analyse the data
* Collecting regular data
The data sources don't seem to publish their historical forecasts. This means that I will need to take snapshots of the data at regular intervals. The first step is therefore to work out how to periodically query a website.
** Periodically querying a website
There are several Python packages for scheduling tasks. First I should try to get one of these to regulary do something like record the clock time. Try https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/
